<h1>Hi, Hello, I'm Donald Hunter, bringing over 20 years of invaluable experience from the United States Army into the dynamic realm of Cloud Security. My military journey was marked by specialization in vehicle maintenance and troubleshooting electrical systems, complemented by the development of robust technical and leadership skills, notably through the completion of the Warrior Leadership course.

Upon my transition from the service, my fascination with cybersecurity took center stage. Eager to delve deeper into this evolving field, I enrolled at Evolved Security‚Äôs Academy and Codeup, where I immersed myself in learning. Throughout this period, I cultivated a blend of technical and professional skills, setting the stage for a seamless transition into the cybersecurity industry.

Currently, I proudly serve as a Cloud Security Engineer with Thales Group, leveraging three years of hands-on experience. Armed with an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification and the Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals Certification, I am well-versed in the intricacies of cloud security. My commitment to staying at the forefront of industry standards is unwavering.

Recognizing the importance of knowledge-sharing, I've established a blog to disseminate insights and experiences gained during my exploration of cybersecurity and cloud technologies. Join me in unraveling the complexities of cloud security, as I fuse my extensive military background with a passion for safeguarding digital assets. </h1>
